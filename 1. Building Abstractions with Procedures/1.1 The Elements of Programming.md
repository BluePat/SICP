# The Elements of Programming

## Programming language
- means for instructing a computer to perform tasks
- framework from within we organize our ideas about processes

There are three mechanisms to form **complex ideas**:
1. **Primitive expressions** - the simplest entities language is is concerned with
2. **Means of combination** - by which compound elements are built from simpler ones
3. **Means of abstraction** - by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units

Any powerful programming language should be able to describe **primitive data** (20, "hi", ...) and **primitive procedures** (+, *, ...) and should have methods for combining and abstracting procedures and data.

## Expressions
- At a computer terminal you type in _expression_ and **interpreter** displays the result of its _evaluation_

### Combinations
- NB: expression formed by delimiting a list of expressions with paranthesis in order to denote **procedure applications**

```Scheme
(+ 10 2 4)
```

- the leftmost element is called **operator**
- other elements are called **operands**
- the value of combination is obtained by applying _the procedure specified by the operator_ to the **arguments** that are values of the operands.
- this arrangement is known as **prefix notation**
    - can accomodate arbitrary number of arguments
- combinations can be easily nested

```Scheme
(+ (+ 1 2) (* 3 1))
```

- interpeter runs in **REPL** _(read-eval-print loop)

## Naming and the Environment
- the name identifies _the variable_ (whose _value_ is the object)

```Scheme
; The code causes interpreter to associate the value `2` with the name `size`.
(define size 2)
```

- interpreter does **name-object associations**

- `define` is Scheme's simplest means of abstraction.
- complex programs are constructed by building step by step computational objects of increasing complexity

### Global Environment
- memory maintaned by interpreter that keeps track of **name-object pairs**.

## Evaluating Combinations

Interpreter follows these steps:
1. Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination
2. Apply **the procedure that is the value of the leftmost subexpression** (_the operator_) to the arguments that are the values of the other subexpression (_the operands_)

- evaluation is **recursive** in nature
- combinations can be represented in the form of a tree
    - _node_: represent a combination
    - _leaf_: represent an operator or another primitive case

- percolation of values upwards in the process of evaluating combinations is example of more general process known as **tree accumulation**

- _NB: environment plays key role in determining the meaning of the symbols in expressions_

### Special Forms

- exceptions to the general evaluation rule

```Scheme
(define x 3)
; Evaluation
; it does not apply `define` to two arguments
; it is evaluated using special rule associating x with 3
; THUS IS NOT A COMBINATION
```

- each special form has its own evaluation rules

### Syntactic sugar

- special syntactic forms that are simply convenient alternative surface structures for things that can be written in more uniform ways

## Compound Procedures

### Procedure definition
- powerful abstraction technique (_means of abstraction_) by which **compound operations** can be given a name and refered to as a unit.

```Scheme
(define (square x) (* x x)
; Formal Procedure definition
; (define (<name> <formal parameters>) (<body>))
```

- **name** - a symbol to be associated with the procedure definition
- **formal parameters** - the names used within the body of the procedure to refer to the corresponding arguments of the procedure
- **body** - an expression that will yield the value pf the procedure when formal parameters are replaced by the actual arguments to which the procedure is applied.

## The Substitution Model for Procedural Application

- the interpreter evaluates the elements of the combination and applies the procedure (_the operator_) to the arguments (_the operands_)

**Mechanism for applying primitive procedures to arguments**:   
- built into the interpreter

**Mechanism for applying a compound procedure to arguments**:  
- evaluate the body of the procedure with each formal parameter replaced by the corresponding argument

```Scheme
(f 5)  ; body of `f`: `(sum-of-squares (+ a 1) (* a 2))`
(sum-of-squares (+ 5 1) (* 5 2))
(+ (square 6) (square 10))  ; body of `square`: `(* x x)`
(+ (* 6 6) (* 10 10))
(+ 36 100)
136
```

Notes:
- purpose of the substitution is to help us think about procedure application (it is not a description of how the interpreter really works)
- the substitution is achieved by **using a local environment**

### Applicative order vs normal order

- **Normal-order evaluation**: an alternative evaluation model that would not evaluate the operands until their values were needed
- _"fully expand and then reduce"_

```Scheme
; Expansion
(f 5)
(sum-of-squares (+ 5 1) (* 5 2))
(+ (* (+ 5 1) (+ 5 1)) (* (* 5 2) (* 5 2)))

; Reduction
(+ (* 6 6) (* 10 10))
(+ 36 100)
136
```

- compiler actually uses **applicative-order evaluation**
- for procedure applications _that can be modeled using substitution_ and _that yield legitimate values_, normal-order and applicative-order evaluation produce the same value.

## Conditional Expressions and Predicates

### Case analysis

```Scheme
(define abs 
; (cond (<p1> <e1>) (<p2> <e2>))
; (<predicate> <expression>) - special form called `clause`
  (cond ((> x 0) x)
        ((= x 0) 0)
        ((< x 0) (- x))))
```

- predicate is an expression whose value is interpreted as either true or false

The predicate ⟨p1⟩ is evaluated first. If its value is false, then ⟨p2⟩ is evaluated. If ⟨p2⟩’s value is also false, then ⟨p3⟩ is evaluated. This process continues until a predicate is found whose value is true, in which case the interpreter returns the value of the corresponding consequent expression ⟨e⟩ of the clause as the value of the conditional expression.  
**If none of the ⟨p⟩’s is found to be true, the value of the cond is undefined.**

```Scheme
(define (abs x)
  (cond ((< x 0) (- x))
    (else x)))
```

- `else` is a special symbol, that can be used in case o predicate in the final _clause_ in `cond`

```Scheme
(define (abs x)
  (if (< x 0)
      (- x) 
      x))
```

- `if` is a special form. It is restricted for use when there are precisely two cases in the case analysis.
```Scheme
(if ⟨predicate⟩ ⟨consequent⟩ ⟨alternative⟩)
```

- compound predicates can by created by _composition operators_: `or`, `and`, `not`

```Scheme
(define (>= x y)
  (or (> x y) (= x y)))
```
