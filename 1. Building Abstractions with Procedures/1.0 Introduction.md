# Computational process

## Process
- an abstract entity
- its evolution manipulatest data 

## Program
- pattern of rules, that directs evolution of a process
- composed from symbolic expressions in programming language

## Lisp
- LISt Processing
- family of dialects
- 2nd oldest "language" in use (after Fortran)
- developed in 1950s as a formalisim to reason about **recursion equations** (kind of logical equations)
- designed to provide symbol manipulating capabilities (ex. _symbolic differentiation and integration of algebraic expressions_)
- it was very inefficient for numerical computations, but **Lisp compilers** have been developed to translate the programs into machine code, taht can perform numerical computations resonably efficiently.
- excellent medium for studying important data structures and programming constructs

### Lisp Interpreter
- a machine that carries out processes described in Lisp language

### Procedures
- Lisp description of processes
- can be represented an manipulated as Lip data (first order citizens?)
- there are powerful program-design techniques that blur distinction between "active" processes and "passive" data
